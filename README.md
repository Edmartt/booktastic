# Booktastic

Booktastic is a project born with the idea of keeping track of the books I have acquired, that I have read, that I am reading, that I have to acquire and some details that I will add.

Something particular about this repository, is that it will not have code as such, but the particularities regarding the design of the system. I will be leaving the links to the related code, since I will use a microservices oriented architecture, therefore the general architecture and general sequence diagrams will be placed here. In the respective repositories of the microservices will be the architecture diagrams and the particularities of each microservice.
